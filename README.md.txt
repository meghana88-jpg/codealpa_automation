# CodeAlpha Task 3: Task Automation with Python Scripts

## 📌 Project Description
This project automates the repetitive task of moving JPG and JPEG image files from a source folder to a destination folder using Python.

The script scans the source folder, identifies image files, and moves them automatically to the destination folder.

## 🎯 Objective
To learn how Python can automate everyday file-management tasks and reduce manual work.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- VS Code

## 📚 Python Concepts Used
- `os` module
- `shutil` module
- File handling
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- File and folder paths

## ✨ Features
- Automatically identifies JPG and JPEG images.
- Moves images from the Source folder to the Destination folder.
- Creates the Destination folder if it does not exist.
- Avoids overwriting files with the same name.
- Displays the filenames moved and the total number of images moved.

## 📂 Project Structure

├── move_images.py
├── README.md
├── Source/
└── Destination/
```

**Note:** The Source folder contains the images before execution. The Destination folder receives the images after the script runs.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Install Python on your computer.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Place JPG or JPEG images inside the `Source` folder.
4. Open the terminal in the project folder.
5. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python move_images.py
   ```

6. Check the `Destination` folder to see the moved images.

## 💻 Sample Output

```text
Starting JPG Image Automation...
Source folder: ...\codealpa_Automation\Source
Destination folder: ...\codealpa_Automation\Destination
Moved: Cosmic wallpaper.jpg
Moved: pexels-aleksandra-larry-77353944-35964264.jpg
Moved: venkateshwara swamy.jpg
--------------------------------
Total images moved: 3
Automation completed successfully!
```

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Python can automate file management by moving image files between folders. It helped me practice Python modules, loops, conditional statements, and file operations.
